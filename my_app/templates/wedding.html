                *We are sorry to announce this but the reservation of the hotel needs to be made by yourself.
                Summit Hotel USJ is only recommended by us since the groom's family will also stay there. 
                As it is up to you where to stay, you can book a hotel anywhere around Kuala Lumpur/Subang Jaya.

                <b>Transport</b><br>
                Grab, a ride-hailing service like Uber, is dominant and the most convenient when it comes to traveling across East Malaysia.
                We suggest you download the app and create your own account before departing from your own country.

                <b>What to wear</b><br>
                As our wedding is held in a mosque, ladies, especially, have some rules in what to wear. 
                please follow the guideline of what to wear below:<br>

                If you wonder if the attire you are going to wear is proper, please feel free to ask Nori/Amira.

                <b>Allowance</b><br>
                We will compensate you RM200 if you are from abroad.
                This amount was set based on the average price for one-night stay in Summit Hotel USJ (100RM) and the approximate Grab fee of the round trip between KLCC and Iron Mosque (100RM).
